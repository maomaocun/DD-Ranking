## Motivation: DD Lacks an Evaluation Benchmark

<details>
<summary>Unfold to see more details.</summary>
<br>
Dataset Distillation (DD) aims to condense a large dataset into a much smaller one, which allows a model to achieve comparable performance after training on it. DD has gained extensive attention since it was proposed. With some foundational methods such as DC, DM, and MTT, various works have further pushed this area to a new standard with their novel designs.

![history](./static/history.png)

Notebaly, more and more methods are transitting from "hard label" to "soft label" in dataset distillation, especially during evaluation. **Hard labels** are categorical, having the same format of the real dataset. **Soft labels** are outputs of a pre-trained teacher model. 
Recently, Deng et al., pointed out that "a label is worth a thousand images". They showed analytically that soft labels are exetremely useful for accuracy improvement. 

However, since the essence of soft labels is **knowledge distillation**, we find that when applying the same evaluation method to randomly selected data, the test accuracy also improves significantly (see the figure above).

This makes us wonder: **Can the test accuracy of the model trained on distilled data reflect the real informativeness of the distilled data?**

Additionally, we have discoverd unfairness of using only test accuracy to demonstrate one's performance from the following three aspects:
1. Results of using hard and soft labels are not directly comparable since soft labels introduce teacher knowledge.
2. Strategies of using soft labels are diverse. For instance, different objective functions are used during evaluation, such as soft Cross-Entropy and Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence. Also, one image may be mapped to one or multiple soft labels.
3. Different data augmentations are used during evaluation.

Motivated by this, we propose DD-Ranking, a new benchmark for DD evaluation. DD-Ranking provides a fair evaluation scheme for DD methods that can decouple the impacts from knowledge distillation and data augmentation to reflect the real informativeness of the distilled data.

## Introduction

<details>
<summary>Unfold to see more details.</summary>
<br>
DD-Ranking (DD, *i.e.*, Dataset Distillation) is an integrated and easy-to-use benchmark for dataset distillation. It aims to provide a fair evaluation scheme for DD methods that can decouple the impacts from knowledge distillation and data augmentation to reflect the real informativeness of the distilled data.

<!-- Hard label is tested -->
<!-- Keep the same compression ratio, comparing with random selection -->
### Benchmark

Revisit the original goal of dataset distillation: 
> The idea is to synthesize a small number of data points that do not need to come from the correct data distribution, but will, when given to the learning algorithm as training data, approximate the model trained on the original data. (Wang et al., 2020)
>

The evaluation method for DD-Ranking is grounded in the essence of dataset distillation, aiming to better reflect the informativeness of the synthesized data by assessing the following two aspects:  
1. The degree to which the real dataset is recovered under hard labels (hard label recovery): $\text{HLR}=\text{Acc.}{\text{real-hard}}-\text{Acc.}{\text{syn-hard}}$.  

2. The improvement over random selection when using personalized evaluation methods (improvement over random): $\text{IOR}=\text{Acc.}{\text{syn-any}}-\text{Acc.}{\text{rdm-any}}$.
$\text{Acc.}$ is the accuracy of models trained on different samples. Samples' marks are as follows:
- $\text{real-hard}$: Real dataset with hard labels;
- $\text{syn-hard}$: Synthetic dataset with hard labels;
- $\text{syn-any}$: Synthetic dataset with personalized evaluation methods (hard or soft labels);
- $\text{rdm-any}$: Randomly selected dataset (under the same compression ratio) with the same personalized evaluation methods.

DD-Ranking uses a weight sum of $\text{IOR}$ and $-\text{HLR}$ to rank different methods:
$\alpha = w\text{IOR}-(1-w)\text{HLR}, \quad w \in [0, 1]$

Formally, the **DD-Ranking Score (DDRS)** is defined as:
$(e^{\alpha}-e^{-1}) / (e - e^{-1})$

By default, we set $w = 0.5$ on the leaderboard, meaning that both $\text{IOR}$ and $\text{HLR}$ are equally important. Users can adjust the weights to emphasize one aspect on the leaderboard.

## Overview

DD-Ranking is integrated with:
- Multiple [strategies](https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/DD-Ranking/tree/main/dd_ranking/loss) of using soft labels in existing works;
- Commonly used [data augmentation](https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/DD-Ranking/tree/main/dd_ranking/aug) methods in existing works;
- Commonly used [model architectures](https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/DD-Ranking/blob/main/dd_ranking/utils/networks.py) in existing works.

DD-Ranking has the following features:
- **Fair Evaluation**: DD-Ranking provides a fair evaluation scheme for DD methods that can decouple the impacts from knowledge distillation and data augmentation to reflect the real informativeness of the distilled data.
- **Easy-to-use**: DD-Ranking provides a unified interface for dataset distillation evaluation.
- **Extensible**: DD-Ranking supports various datasets and models.
- **Customizable**: DD-Ranking supports various data augmentations and soft label strategies.

DD-Ranking currently includes the following datasets and methods (categorized by hard/soft label). Our replication of the following baselines can be found at the [methods](https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/DD-Ranking/tree/methods) branch. Evaluation results can be found in the [leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Soptq/DD-Ranking) and evaluation configurations can be found at the [eval](https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/DD-Ranking/tree/eval) branch.

## Tutorial

Install DD-Ranking with `pip` or from [source](https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/DD-Ranking/tree/main):

### Installation

From pip

```bash
pip install ddranking
```

From source

```bash
python setup.py install
```
### Quickstart

Below is a step-by-step guide on how to use our `dd_ranking`. This demo is based on soft labels (source code can be found in `demo_soft.py`). You can find hard label demo in `demo_hard.py`.

**Step1**: Intialize a soft-label metric evaluator object. Config files are recommended for users to specify hyper-parameters. Sample config files are provided [here](https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/DD-Ranking/tree/main/configs).

```python
from ddranking.metrics import SoftLabelEvaluator
from ddranking.config import Config

config = Config.from_file("./configs/Demo_Soft_Label.yaml")
soft_label_metric_calc = SoftLabelEvaluator(config)
```

<details>
<summary>You can also pass keyword arguments.</summary>

```python
device = "cuda"
method_name = "DATM"                    # Specify your method name
ipc = 10                                # Specify your IPC
dataset = "CIFAR10"                     # Specify your dataset name
syn_data_dir = "./data/CIFAR10/IPC10/"  # Specify your synthetic data path
real_data_dir = "./datasets"            # Specify your dataset path
model_name = "ConvNet-3"                # Specify your model name
teacher_dir = "./teacher_models"		# Specify your path to teacher model chcekpoints
im_size = (32, 32)                      # Specify your image size
dsa_params = {                          # Specify your data augmentation parameters
    "prob_flip": 0.5,
    "ratio_rotate": 15.0,
    "saturation": 2.0,
    "brightness": 1.0,
    "contrast": 0.5,
    "ratio_scale": 1.2,
    "ratio_crop_pad": 0.125,
    "ratio_cutout": 0.5
}
save_path = f"./results/{dataset}/{model_name}/IPC{ipc}/dm_hard_scores.csv"

""" We only list arguments that usually need specifying"""
soft_label_metric_calc = SoftLabelEvaluator(
    dataset=dataset,
    real_data_path=real_data_dir, 
    ipc=ipc,
    model_name=model_name,
    soft_label_criterion='sce',  # Use Soft Cross Entropy Loss
    soft_label_mode='S',         # Use one-to-one image to soft label mapping
    data_aug_func='dsa',         # Use DSA data augmentation
    aug_params=dsa_params,       # Specify dsa parameters
    im_size=im_size,
    stu_use_torchvision=False,
    tea_use_torchvision=False,
    teacher_dir='./teacher_models',
    device=device,
    save_path=save_path
)
```
</details>

For detailed explanation for hyper-parameters, please refer to our <a href="">documentation</a>.

**Step 2:** Load your synthetic data, labels (if any), and learning rate (if any).

```python
syn_images = torch.load('/your/path/to/syn/images.pt')
# You must specify your soft labels if your soft label mode is 'S'
soft_labels = torch.load('/your/path/to/syn/labels.pt')
syn_lr = torch.load('/your/path/to/syn/lr.pt')
```

**Step 3:** Compute the metric.

```python
metric = soft_label_metric_calc.compute_metrics(image_tensor=syn_images, soft_labels=soft_labels, syn_lr=syn_lr)
# alternatively, you can specify the image folder path to compute the metric
metric = soft_label_metric_calc.compute_metrics(image_path='./your/path/to/syn/images', soft_labels=soft_labels, syn_lr=syn_lr)
```

The following results will be returned to you:
- `HLR mean`: The mean of hard label recovery over `num_eval` runs.
- `HLR std`: The standard deviation of hard label recovery over `num_eval` runs.
- `IOR mean`: The mean of improvement over random over `num_eval` runs.
- `IOR std`: The standard deviation of improvement over random over `num_eval` runs.
